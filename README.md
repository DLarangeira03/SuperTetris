# 🎮 Tetris in Java

This is my personal implementation of the classic **Tetris** game, developed entirely in **Java**. It features the core mechanics of traditional Tetris, including falling blocks, line clearing, score tracking, and increasing difficulty.

> 🧩 Built from scratch with a custom structure and style – "Tetris at my manner".
